###Help###
If you have a problem or need help using a binary, please first read: http://www.lonelyjoeparker.com/?p=1255
If you think you have found a bug or error please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/lonelyjoeparker/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues).
If you still haven't got any further and want to send a question, email joe+bioinformaticshelp@kitserve.org.uk. I may or may not be able to answer your question quickly. **Please include these details**: 
 * Which Java version, and which jarfile you are using (and where/when you downloaded it);
 * Which OS and version you're using;
 * Error trace from the console (this will usually have the word 'Exception:' and some other lines, probably numbered);
 * The input command and input files as well as any output. **If your input/output files are larger than 1MB, please either send only the first few lines, or else use an online filestore like http://wetransfer.com to send me the whole input.**
