# Introduction #

The QMUL Genome Convergence Pipeline project is an output of the Rossiter Lab at QMUL, managed by Joe Parker. The project is in its infancy and we're still working on core functions at least as much as the graphical user interface (GUI). However, if you are an alpha (test) version user and want to **report a bug** or **request a feature or change** please see below:

# Report/Request #
