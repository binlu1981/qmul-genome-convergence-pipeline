# Introduction #

The QMUL Genome Convergence Pipeline project is an output of the Rossiter Lab at QMUL, managed by Joe Parker. The project is in its infancy and we're still working on core functions at least as much as the graphical user interface (GUI). However, if you are an alpha (test) version user and want to **report a bug** or **request a feature or change** please see below:

# Report/Request #

**Existing bugs** and issues are logged at [https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues/list](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues/list). **Please check here first** to see if the issue you're experiencing has already been documented / fixed.
If you have a **new issue** please report it using the simple form [here](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues/entry).

Please provide as much information as possible.

## Feature requests ##
You can request features and enhancements using [the same form](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues/entry) but again, please [check existing requests first](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/qmul-genome-convergence-pipeline/issues/list).

Thanks very much!
